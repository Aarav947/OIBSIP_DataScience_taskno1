Iris Flower Classification using Machine Learning

## Problem Statement
The Iris flower classification problem involves predicting the species of a flower based on its physical measurements. Using machine learning techniques, the goal is to classify flowers into their respective species using sepal and petal dimensions.

## Dataset
The Iris dataset consists of the following numerical features:
- Sepal Length
- Sepal Width
- Petal Length
- Petal Width

The target variable contains three flower species:
- Iris-setosa
- Iris-versicolor
- Iris-virginica

## Approach
The dataset is preprocessed by removing unnecessary columns and separating features and target labels. A K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) classifier is used to train the model. The dataset is split into training and testing sets, and the trained model is used to predict the species of new flower samples.

## Result
The KNN model successfully classifies iris flowers and accurately predicts the species for new input measurements.

## Technologies Used
- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Jupyter Notebook
